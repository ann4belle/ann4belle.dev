# Party Favors

## Team Roamless Crate

This prevents Roamin' and Super Roamin' players from arriving on our team. It does not prevent any of our players that gain Roamin' or Super Roamin' from leaving our team.

## Team Squiddish Crate

This causes any subsequent incinerations on our team to pull in a random Hall of Flame player instead of (or in addition to? unclear) a brand new player.

## Team Avoidance Crate

This forces our batters to take walks or strikes when we have 9 or more runs.

## Team Containment Crate

This prevents our players from spreading Instability.
