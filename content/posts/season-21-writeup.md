Welcome to **Walnut's Seasonal Blessings Writeup** for Season 21!
I'll attempt to be as objective as possible while describing what each blessing does for the Baltimore Crabs. This may contain FK since I get info from the offseasonSetup API endpoint, so be warned.

## Play to Find Out
Gives all our pitchers the Heist Expert mod. We don't know what this does.

## Trader
Gives one of our batters the Trader mod. We don't know what this does.

## Soul Food
Adds 99 soul to a random non-Shadow player on our team. Soul protects against Redaction at the cost of eDensity.

## Big Head Mode
This gives a random non-Shadow player on our team the Magnify and Ego mods. Magnify multiples any runs batted in or allowed by the player by two. Ego increases eDensity.

## Shadow Brooms Supply Run
All of our Shadows except Jon Halifax, Finn James, and Pedro Davids open a Generic Broom Crate. Brooms give +Divinity, which increases the chance of a home run on a batter.

## Shadow Evolution
Advances every player in our Shadows. Advancing adds an item slot and protects Stars from Consumers.

## Strong Armed
Moves Bertie into our Lineup. Bertie is a better pitcher than batter.

## Liability
Moves Conner Haley into our Rotation. Conner is a better batter than pitcher.

## Cinnamon Challenge
Increases the maximum Vibe level of our non-Shadowed players. We don't know what Vibes do.

## Pressure Cooker
Decreases(?) the minimum Vibe level of our non-Shadowed players. We don't know what Vibes do.

## Shadow Pressure Cooker
Decreases(?) the minimum Vibe level of our Shadowed players. We don't know what Vibes do.

## Gaudy
Gives a random non-Shadowed player from our team the Gaudy mod. Gaudy makes players play better in ballparks with more modifications. We aren't sure how much this affects performance.

## Cluttered
Gives a random non-Shadowed player from our team the Cluttered mod. Cluttered makes players play better in ballparks with higher Filthiness. We aren't sure how much this affects performance.

## Recruit Ego
Steals a random non-Shadowed player from any team that has some level of Ego. Ego increases eDensity. We currently have the only pitcher with Ego - all other non-Shadowed players with Ego are batters.

## Double Negative
Steals two random non-Shadowed players from any team that have Negative. Negative makes eDensity negative. Most of the players with Negative are batters.

## Lineup Alternate Trust
